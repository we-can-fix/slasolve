# GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions Setup Guide

## 📋 Overview

This document explains the GitHub Copilot custom instructions setup for the SLASolve project and how to use it effectively.

---

## ✅ What Has Been Configured

### Repository-Level Instructions

A comprehensive custom instructions file has been created at:
```
.github/copilot-instructions.md
```

This file provides GitHub Copilot with project-specific guidance including:

- **Project Overview**: SLASolve goals and technology stack
- **Code Style Standards**: TypeScript conventions, naming rules, formatting
- **Architecture Patterns**: Controller pattern, middleware, Zod validation
- **Documentation Standards**: JSDoc examples and requirements
- **Testing Guidelines**: Jest best practices and coverage requirements
- **Security Practices**: Environment variables, input validation, error handling
- **Git Workflow**: Branch naming, commit messages, PR checklists

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### Automatic Activation

GitHub Copilot will automatically read and apply these instructions when:

1. ✅ You're working in the `slasolve` repository
2. ✅ GitHub Copilot extension is enabled in your editor
3. ✅ The `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file exists

**No additional setup required!** Copilot reads this file automatically.

## 💡 How to Use

### 1. Basic Code Generation

When you write code, Copilot will follow the project conventions:

```typescript
// Type this comment:
// Create a function to validate provenance

// Copilot will suggest code following the project style:
/**
 * Validates SLSA provenance for a given artifact
 * 
 * @param artifactId - Unique identifier of the artifact
 * @param provenance - Provenance data to validate
 * @returns Validation result with details
 */
async function validateProvenance(
  artifactId: string,
  provenance: Provenance
): Promise<ValidationResult> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### 2. Ask Questions

You can ask Copilot Chat about project-specific practices:

```
Q: "How should I structure a new controller in this project?"
A: Copilot will reference the controller pattern from the instructions

Q: "What testing framework should I use?"
A: Copilot will recommend Jest with the project's testing structure

Q: "How should I name this file?"
A: Copilot will suggest kebab-case following the naming conventions
```

### 3. Code Reviews

Copilot can help review code against project standards:

```
"Does this code follow the project's TypeScript conventions?"
"Is this error handling appropriate for this project?"
"Does this test structure match the project standards?"
```

---

## 🎯 Benefits

### Consistency

- New contributors quickly learn project conventions
- Less time spent on code review for style issues

### Quality
- Automatic adherence to security best practices
- Proper error handling patterns
- Complete documentation with JSDoc

### Efficiency
- Faster development with context-aware suggestions
- Reduced cognitive load remembering all conventions
- Quick answers to project-specific questions

## 🔧 Customization

### Updating Instructions

To modify the custom instructions:

1. Edit `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
2. Commit and push changes
3. Copilot will use the updated instructions immediately

### Testing Changes

After updating instructions:

1. Create a test file
2. Ask Copilot to generate code
3. Verify it follows your updated conventions
4. Adjust instructions if needed

---

## 📊 Instruction Levels

GitHub Copilot uses a hierarchy of custom instructions:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Level           │ Priority │ Scope  │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ User-level      │ Highest  │ You    │
│ Repository      │ Medium   │ This   │ ← We configured this
│ Organization    │ Lowest   │ All    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Repository-level** instructions (what we set up) apply to everyone working on SLASolve.

## 💻 Editor Integration

### VS Code

1. Install GitHub Copilot extension
2. Open the `slasolve` repository
3. Start coding - instructions are automatically active

### JetBrains IDEs

1. Install GitHub Copilot plugin
2. Open the `slasolve` project
3. Instructions are automatically loaded

### Other Editors

GitHub Copilot in any supported editor will read the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file.

## 📝 Best Practices

### For Code Generation

1. **Be Specific**: Write clear comments about what you want
2. **Use Examples**: Reference existing code patterns
3. **Iterate**: Refine suggestions by adding more context

### For Learning

1. **Ask Questions**: Use Copilot Chat to understand project patterns
2. **Compare**: Generate code and compare with existing implementations
3. **Document**: Let Copilot help write JSDoc based on function signatures

### For Reviews

1. **Check Consistency**: Verify generated code matches project style
2. **Security**: Ensure no hard-coded secrets or unsafe patterns
3. **Tests**: Always add tests for generated code

---

## 🔍 Verification

### Check If Instructions Are Working

1. Create a new TypeScript file
2. Start typing a function
3. Check if Copilot suggests:
   - JSDoc comments
   - Single quotes for strings
   - Proper TypeScript types
   - Error handling patterns

If suggestions don't follow the instructions:
1. Reload your editor
2. Check if `.github/copilot-instructions.md` exists
3. Ensure Copilot extension is up to date

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Do I need to do anything to activate these instructions?

**A:** No! If you have GitHub Copilot installed and are working in the repository, the instructions are automatically active.

### Q: Can I override these instructions?

**A:** Yes! You can set user-level instructions in your GitHub settings that will take priority over repository instructions.

### Q: Will this work in GitHub Codespaces?

**A:** Yes! Codespaces include GitHub Copilot, and repository instructions work there too.

### Q: How often are instructions updated?

**A:** The instructions are version-controlled in the repository. Any commits to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` immediately update what Copilot sees.

### Q: Do instructions affect repository size?

**A:** The instructions file is ~13KB, which is negligible and well within recommended limits.
